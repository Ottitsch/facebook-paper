Assignment: Reproducibility and Extension Challenge

Objective: Reproduce key experiments from a machine learning research paper from the list above and/or extend the results in a novel way, and present your findings in a PowerPoint presentation.

Deliverables:

1. PowerPoint presentation detailing the understanding, reproduction, and extension of the chosen paper.

2. Github code to the implementation of the paper/extensions

3. Be present for individual group sessions to discuss personal contributions after the group presentation and answer questions from the course.

Group Work:

- Students will form groups of three to maximum four. Each group will select one paper from the provided list. We prefer each group to select a single paper but exceptions can be made. Students can propose paper to me.

Presentation Guidelines
  - Duration: 20 minutes

Structure:

  - Introduction: Briefly introduce the paper and its key contributions.

  - Understanding: Demonstrate a clear understanding of the paper. Explain the main concepts, methods, and results.

  - Reproduction: Show the reproduction of key experiments from the paper. Include code snippets, datasets used, and any challenges faced.

  - Extension: Present any novel extensions or additional experiments conducted. Discuss the rationale behind these extensions and their outcomes.

  - Conclusion: Summarize the findings and discuss the reproducibility of the original paper’s results. Offer insights into the extensions and suggest possible future work.

Individual group Sessions: 20 minutes 

Each group will have an individual session with the instructor.

- Purpose:

  - Explain their personal contribution to the project.

  - Demonstrate their understanding of the overall project work.

  - Answer any questions related to the reproduction and extension work.

Advice on Experiment Reproduction:

If you find that reproducing the experiments is taking too long, consider using a subset of the original dataset to demonstrate the principles outlined in the paper. This approach can save time while still effectively illustrating the key concepts and methods. Ensure that the subset chosen is representative enough to provide meaningful insights comparable to the full dataset.

Important Notes:

-Code Submission: All code must be made available in a public GitHub repository. Include a link to the repository in the presentation.

- Use of External Code: If using publicly available code, clearly acknowledge and document any modifications made. More extensive extensions are expected if significant portions of the code are reused.
